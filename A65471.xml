            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO A LATE PAPER, INTITULED, <hi>A True Copy of a Paper Written</hi> By Capt. THO. WALCOT In <hi>Newgate</hi> after his CONDEMNATION, and Delivered to his Son immediately before his EXECUTION; being alſo his Laſt Speech at the Place of <hi>Execution.</hi>
            </head>
            <byline>By <hi>ROBERT WEST.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>AS I will always be tender of any mans Life, ſo I would be of his Fame after his Death; but the Duty I owe to my ſelf, and to truth, obliges me to give an Anſwer to part of this Pamphlet. Though through God's and the King's Mercy I am not at the apparent point of Death, yet I will declare the truth as ſincerely as if I were ſo: for I hope I am much more convinced of the Horridneſs of my Crime, and have more truly Repented of it than Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> ſeems by this Paper to have done; for notwithſtanding his large Profeſſion of his Faith there, He has not ſtuck to inſert as many falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods in this laſt Paper, as any man that ſuffered in the <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> is charged to have done in his Laſt Speech.</p>
            <p>In <hi>October</hi> laſt Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> acquainted me that there was a Deſign to Aſſaſſinate the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Duke</hi> in their return that Month from <hi>Newmarket;</hi> and that if that were not effected, an Inſurrection was intended on the Nineteenth of <hi>Nov.</hi> following, which was the firſt knowledge I had of any Real Plot whatſoever carrying on againſt the <hi>King.</hi> He told me indeed though he thought an Aſſaſſination Lawful, he look'd upon it as an ungenerous thing, and therefore would not engage Perſonally in it; but he told me he would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the Inſurrection, and expected to be a <hi>Coll.</hi> of <hi>Horſe,</hi> and would have had me taken a Command under Him, which I refuſed; and he deſired me to buy Him a Tuck and lend him my ſilk Armour, which I agreed to do. To this he gave no Anſwer at his Tryal, nor gives any in this Paper: ſo that he tacitely Confeſſes it true, which I think is a clear Evidence that he firſt drew me into Plots, and I did not draw him into any.</p>
            <p>The Aſſaſſination not taking effect in <hi>October,</hi> and the intended Inſurrection being diverted, I had ſeveral diſcourſes with <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> who as Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> told me, had the chief management of it, concerning an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Aſſaſſination after the ſeveral manners I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in my Evidence at Capt. <hi>Walcots</hi> Tryal; at ſome of which I think Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> was preſent, and I am ſure he was made privy to them all by me (he coming often to my Chamber) and by <hi>Ferguſon</hi> with whom he was very intimate. He always approved of it, but, to do him right here as I did at his Tryal, he ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to engage Perſonally in it for the ſame reaſon of it's being diſhonourable. About the Nineteenth or Twentieth of <hi>Nov.</hi> he and <hi>Ferguſon</hi> went with the late E. of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> into <hi>Holland,</hi> and return'd to <hi>London</hi> about <hi>Aſh-wedneſday</hi> laſt. In their abſence ſome diſcourſes were had concerning an Aſſaſſination and an Inſurrection, but no reſolutions were taken by us till their return. Then <hi>Ferguſon</hi> undertook the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an Aſſaſſination, and to procure money to carry it on, and at one meeting told us he had engag'd Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> to Act in it, and that the Capt. would meet us for the Future, which he did ſeveral times as oft as his Gout would let him; particularly he met us twice or thrice about a fortnight before the <hi>Kings</hi> laſt return from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and then declared he would be one to fight the <hi>Guards,</hi> but would not ſet
<pb facs="tcp:99822:2"/>upon the Coach; not out of any ſcruple of Conſcience, (as he falſly inſinuates in his Paper, we alledg'd he did,) but out of a ſcruple of honour; ſaying it was baſe to ſet upon a naked man, but to fight armed men had darger and ſome bravery in it. After news of the fire at <hi>Newmar<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et</hi> he met us twice more to conſider whether the attempt might be made notwithſtanding the <hi>King's</hi> ſuddain return; at both, which times he continued to expreſs his reſolution, to be one to fight the <hi>Guards.</hi> I conſeſs he ſaid it might bring a reproach upon his Children, and therefore de<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red to have his name con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd, and did urge, the D. of <hi>Monmuth</hi> might revenge the <hi>Kings</hi> Death for his own Vindication; but that objection was taken off by reſolving to kill the Duke of <hi>Monmuth,</hi> if he did offer to puniſh the Acters, and <hi>Fer<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uſon,</hi> not my ſelf, undertook the Duke ſhould not. All the injury I did Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> in my Evidence was the omiſſion of an expreſſion of his when he declared he would fight the <hi>Guards,</hi> which in that multitude of particulars I then deliver'd, ſlipt my memory, <hi>viz.</hi> that he look'd upon the Action to be ſo lawful and Juſtifiable that he could die in it with a ſafe Conſcience: ſo far was he from making any ſcruple of Conſcience to Act in it.</p>
            <p>He owns being at ſome meetings where diſcourſes were held concerning aſſerting our Liberties and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, yet mentions not what thoſe diſcourſes were, but would inſinuate they were to ſome other purpoſe, and calls it his misfortune and unhappineſs that he was preſent at them. Thoſe diſcourſes were only about an Aſſaſſination and an Inſurrection, and the misfortune was of his own chooſing: for if he did not come over from <hi>Ireland</hi> principally for ſuch purpoſes, I am ſure he told me he ſtaid in <hi>England</hi> for them, and 'twas only his <hi>Gout</hi> hindred him from the unhappineſs (as he calls it) of being at every Meeting.</p>
            <p>'Tis very true I went ſeveral times to viſit him after his return from <hi>Holland</hi> when he had the <hi>Gout,</hi> but went alone but twice or thrice, and one of thoſe times he was got abroad. I uſually gave him an account of what paſſed at the Meetings when he was abſent, but I did not urge an Aſſaſſination at the <hi>Play-houſe</hi> as he falſely ſuggeſts; For after his and <hi>Ferguſon</hi>'s return from <hi>Holland,</hi> it was agreed to lay aſide all Attempts any where but in the return from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and all the debates were about mangaging that. What I talk'd to him about the <hi>Play-houſe,</hi> was before his voyage into <hi>Holland;</hi> and though I believe I did uſe that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to him, and afterward to <hi>Rumbold, [that at the Play houſe they would die in their Calling]</hi> I only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated it after <hi>Ferguſon</hi> who was the firſt Author of that ſaying. The Arms he mentioned to be bought by me, were agreed to be bought at a full Meeting, but not till <hi>Eaſter</hi> and after the <hi>Kings</hi> return from <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market;</hi> and Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> was preſent at that Meeting, and joyn'd in the directions about the nature and ſizes of thoſe Arms. The Arms were <hi>Blunderbuſſes, Carbines,</hi> and <hi>Horſe-Piſtolls,</hi> which certainly were very improper, to be uſed at a <hi>Play-houſe,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> was then going to reſide at <hi>Windſor</hi> and <hi>Wincheſter</hi> for all the Summer, as was reported; and therefore no man in his ſenſes can believe I bought them for that purpoſe, or could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the effecting it at a <hi>Play-houſe,</hi> but muſt look upon that as a malicious charge upon me, and his pretence to forgive <hi>us</hi> only a piece of Hypocritical and cuſtomary Cant. There was then ſome propoſal by <hi>Ferguſon</hi> to ſee for an opportunity of an Aſſaſſination between <hi>Windſor</hi> and <hi>Hampton-Court;</hi> but all thoughts of that and of the <hi>Play-houſe</hi> which was then alſo nam'd, were ſoon laid aſide, and a General Inſurrection became the thing only intended. 'Tis true he never ſaw the Arms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were never fetch'd from the <hi>Gunſmith</hi> till after the Diſcovery, but he was very Intimate and familiar with <hi>Rumbold</hi> who was to be the principal Acter in the Aſſaſſination, and was at moſt of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and parti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ularly at that when the Arms were agreed to be bought. The men to commit the Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation were all provided by <hi>Ferguſon, Rumbold</hi> and <hi>Goodenough,</hi> as Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> very well knew, and not one to be procured by Coll. <hi>Rumſey</hi> or my ſelf. He thought not fit to urge any thing of this at his Tryal, becauſe he knew he could be ſo eaſily anſwered.</p>
            <p>As to the Combination he charges me and Coll. <hi>Rumſey</hi> with to ſwear his agreement to fight the <hi>Guards,</hi> nothing can be more improbable. We parted at his Lodgings to ſeveral pla<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es unknown to each other, and after we were in cuſtody were kept cloſe Priſoners without the poſſibility of ſending a Note to, or receiving one from each other or any body elſe, and we ſaw not each other till we were called to give Evidence, and I had delivered my Evidence to the King (and ſo I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Coll. <hi>Rumſey</hi> had his) before Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> was taken. Neither was there any neceſſity to contrive ſuch a Charge againſt him, for his being at any meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and debates which he confeſſes, was ſufficient to make him Guilty of <hi>High Treaſon</hi> Had he not been conſcious how fully we could charge him, he would not have directed his Son to tamper with Coll <hi>Rumſey</hi> and me to mince our Evidence againſt him, as appeared by a Note produced at his Tryal. I am not concerned at the ſly denunciation of judgments upon us, which is an uſual thing with Men of his perſwaſion (and it may be he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended us to the revenge of his Sons or ſome of his friends) but wiſh he were no more guilty of prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating with God, than I am of Perjury in my Evidence. He hath not thought fit to expreſs in this Paper any ſenſe of his Guilt or Repentance for it, but rather ſeems to retain his Old Opinion of it's being a lawful thing. He only blames his own Credulity, and adviſes his friends only againſt truſting men, not againſt his crime, and in effect repeats what he ſaid to us at our part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the diſcovery, <hi>viz,</hi> that he believ'd God would yet deliver the Nation, but he did not like the preſent Inſtruments who have undertaken it.</p>
            <p>If it ſhall pleaſe the <hi>King</hi> to ſpare my Life for my Confeſſion and Repentance, it is a great happineſs I can have it for doing no more than my Duty. By his Letter to the <hi>Secretary</hi> of <hi>State</hi> produced at his Tryal, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared he would gladly have ſav'd his own ſo, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to have made the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>M.</hi> and other Perſons of Quality's blood (to uſe his own Phraſe) the Price of his own Life: which is a full Anſwer to that Popular Objection he makes againſt our Evidence.</p>
